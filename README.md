# LAPMOD
Fast Linear Assignment Problem Solver

An implementation of __LAPMOD__ based on the original Pascal code in
A. Volgenant, Linear and Semi Assignment Problems: a core oriented approach,
Computers & Operations Research 23 917-932, 1996.

The test problems are taken from J. E. Beasley,
Linear programming on Cray supercomputers
Journal of the Operational Research Society 41 (1990) 133-139.
